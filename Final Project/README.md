# Final Project
The final group project was to predict the LAFD's response time, given multiple metrics. We ended up using extreme gradient boosting. Our group was chosen as a top 10 group for this project, based on accuracy of our prediction on testing data. We used outside data as well as trial and error in exploring multiple different machine learning algorithms.

## Content
I have included the powerpoint presentation that details all the steps and processes we went through to get to our final result. Because we had to complete the project in a limited time, our codes are a bit messy and not as well documented as we would have liked. I have included all the multiple .R files we ran.

## Future Tasks
Using external data proved to be most useful, so looking into other outside metrics, such as traffic data, would help our accuracy rate. Moreover, in the future, we would like to better document our code.
