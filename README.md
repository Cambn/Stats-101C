# Stats 101C
Stats 101C is Introduction to Statistical Models and Data Mining, which I took under Professor Akram Almohalwas in Spring of 2017. I have included 6 homework assignments and the final group project. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to showcase my skills in R. My final grade in the class was a B+, however I did not score perfectly on all of the assignments. My grades for the 6 homework assignments and final group project are as follows:

|   Assignment  | Grade  | Median |  Mean  |
----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| HW 1          | 96%   | 88%   | 85%    |
| HW 2          | 88%    | 95%   | 91%    |
| HW 3          | 91%   | 92%   | 86%   |
| HW 4          | 80%   | 100%   | 100%   |
| HW 5          | 94%   | 97%    | 93%    |
| HW 5          | 100%   | 100%    | 97%    |
